When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Then one could access it from anywhere, and easily share it with collaborators

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If one were working with intermediate commits that consituted an incomplete project, one may not wish to make such projects public.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are clones that are intended to remain associated with the original repo, but are not officially part of it.  Branches seem "offical" forks.  Clones seem pure copies of repositories.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It would not be subject to constant change, and one could work offline

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    One could exchange files; however, just about everything (that occurs to me) would be harder

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    When you want to consider adding a new feature, or fixing a bug
